# ODROID-GO

These files are binaries pre-built from the Adruino sketches. You can upload them to the ODROID-GO with the ESP32 upload tool, but the upload will overwrite the standard firmware loader.

Better is to convert these `.ino.bin` files into `.fw` files, and copy them onto the SD card. Then you can select them with the firmware selector when you power-on the ODROID-GO while pressing the 'B' button.

Copy .fw files to your SD card "odroid/firmware/" folder
